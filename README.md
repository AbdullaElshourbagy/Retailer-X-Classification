# Project Introduction
Retailer X is boutique retailer with only one physical location. They believe that their niche in the market is attributable to their unique flair of affordable, everyday items, including health and beauty, electronics, specialty treats, and apparel.

Their marketing is mostly word-of-mouth and a “surprise value” coupon that is sent to loyalty members, and an occasional coupon that is offered in support of local school fundraising efforts.

The retailer has interest in growing and potentially selling their products through new channels and is looking for some direction for an expansion strategy. They heard about analytics and want to see what it can do for them.

After facilitating a workshop with the client (Retailer X), you understand that they want to know who their customers are, and how to reach the right customers through targeted messaging:

They want to know what factors are associated with increased levels of spending in their stores. They want to know what drives participation in their coupon and loyalty programs. You learn that Retailer X recently conducted some customer research around customer satisfaction and discovered the following information:

They were shocked to learn that poorer than expected store experience scores were driven by the stores’ failure to have the appropriate amounts of stock on the shelves to meet the demands of their customers. They want to ensure that if they expand and experience increased demand for their products that they have the appropriate amount of stock on hand each day.
